1. Automated Low Stock Alerts
Problem: Manually checking which perfumes need restocking is time-consuming.
Solution: Add a stored procedure that runs daily and emails you when stock is low.

sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE check_low_stock(IN threshold INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT p.idPerfume, p.perfumeName, p.stockQuantity 
    FROM perfumes p
    WHERE p.stockQuantity < threshold;
END //
DELIMITER ;
Usage: Call CALL check_low_stock(10); to see all perfumes with less than 10 units in stock.
